A Starter Boilerplate for TensorFlow.js web apps in plain html and javascript

A starter app created as a start into using tensorflow to attempt ml in the browser
1. here we are implementing simple linear regression
2. A set of input and output tensors is given into the model to train
3. And then we send in inputs on which the model predicts the output.
